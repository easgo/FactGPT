The regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The top eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs, which are held from April to June. 

The playoffs are a best-of-seven series, with the winner of each series advancing to the next round until the conference champions are determined. The two conference champions then face off in the NBA Finals, also a best-of-seven series, to determine the league champion. 

During the offseason, teams can make trades, sign free agents, and participate in the NBA Draft to acquire new players. The NBA also has a salary cap, which limits how much teams can spend on player salaries. 

Overall, the NBA is a highly competitive and popular league, with millions of fans around the world following their favorite teams and players.1. How many teams are in the NBA?

The topmost node of the tree is called the root node. Each node in a binary tree can have zero, one, or two children. If a node has no children, it is called a leaf node. 

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for various applications such as searching, sorting, and indexing. They are also used in data compression algorithms, database indexing, and in the implementation of various data structures such as heaps and binary search trees.

Binary trees can be classified into different types based on their structure, such as full binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and degenerate (or pathological) binary trees. The performance of operations on a binary tree depends on its structure, and different types of binary trees have different performance characteristics.1. What is a binary tree?
